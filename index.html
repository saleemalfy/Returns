        <h3>Returns</h3>
        <br>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            Returns are accepted on most, but not all(*) parts. In case of return, you need to specify the reason of your return request.</p>

        <p>
            If you receive your part and you wish to return it, please do so within the first 2 days of receiving the part, as we will not accept returns requests once two days from you receiving the part have past. All parts are marked before shipping, so the exact marking has to match our records.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All returned parts have to be returned in original condition, without any signs of abuse, defects from improper installation, handling or damage during shipping. In case of returns parts would have to be shipped back to us at the expense of the buyer. Once the part has been received in its original condition we will issue the buyer a refund for the price of the part minus 20% restocking fee (**) </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            (*)Absolutely no returns on any body parts parts, heavy freight parts or electrical components parts, except starters and Alternators. If you do not agree to these terms, please don’t buy. Extracting these parts (body parts, and heavy parts that are shipped by freight) and packaging them is labour intensive and can be costly for us. We are a small business trying to provide customers with affordable car parts. We are not a charity, and nobody likes to work for free!</p>
        <br>

        <p>
            (**) Please note that your refund will not include the shipping fees, for obvious reasons. Example: you bought an alternator for 60$ and the shipping fees were 20$. Grand total will be 80$. If you wish to return the part, you would have to pay for the shipping fees yourself to have it shipped back to us. Once we receive the alternator and its in the origional condition, we reimburse you 60*80%=48$.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            This returns policy is to help us provide you with quality services for an Affordable price. As all parts require time and labour to extract, test, package properly and then ship to you without delay.
        </p>


        <p>To spare us and you the inconvenience of having to return an item, please try to be as descriptive as you can when placing an order. Please specify car make, model, year of manufacture and most importantly the VIN <i>(vehicle identification number)</i> for it. Only if applicable, please also specify trim and color. If it was a piece of interior trim, don’t forget to mention color name, shade. Sometimes in some special cases a picture will be very helpful. Like Confucius said, “a picture is worth a thousand words”.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>Please Note that all body parts you order may need to be painted to match the color of your car. So if your car is red, and you need a complete door with hinges for it, dont expect to receive a red door for your car.</p>
        <br>

        <p>If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact us by filling out the contact us form.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please note that any queries regarding availability of a part, without the 2.99$ request fee will be disrgarded. This way nither us nor you waste time. and we guarentee that all queries are genuine.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Again, if you pay for the request fee, and we don't happen to have the part, which is highly unlikely, as we have a big stock, you will be refunded the request fees. This way you can not go wrong. </p>
        <br>
        <p>From AGP, BUY with Confidence.
        </p>
